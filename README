This project is still in pre-release development. Not ready even for alpha
testing.

Pieces:
 build_pbs_ifl -- Shell script to build python interface to PBS IFL routines,
  using swig. For now, the script needs to be modified to tell it where the
  OpenPBS sources are and to add swig to the PATH.
 nas_field_format.py -- Functions to compute string values for fields
 nas_layout.py -- The layout engine that handles field justification, widths,
  headers, etc.
 nas_utils.py -- BatchUtils functions copied from PTL
 nas_pbsutil.py -- Python versions of C routines used by C qstat
 nas_qstat -- Main routine of python qstat
 nas_rstat -- Python version of pbs_rstat
 pbs_ifl.i -- Slightly modified version of OpenPBS's swig input file to build
  pbs_ifl module
